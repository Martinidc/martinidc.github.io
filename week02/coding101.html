  <h2 style="color: purple;">A Brief  History of Me</h2>

  <p>I am the only member of my family to be born in Texas. I have always loved video games, especially sci-fi first-person shooters such as <em>Halo</em>, <em>BO2</em>, & <em> No Mans Sky</em>.

  In my junior year of high school, I found a youtube video about a company called <em>Space X</em>. The idea of reusability of rockets seemed like a far fetched fantasy, until December 21st, 2015. This was the first successful landing of an orbital rocket in history. This event is what lead to my interest in Aerospace Engineering.
